# Security

This folder contains policy, SBOM, and attestation artifacts.

- **policies/**: Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego files defining admission & capability rules.  
- **sboms/**: software bill of materials generated by Syft/Trivy.  
- **attestations/**: signed provenance data (Cosign/Sigstore).

## Purpose
Enforces zero-trust supply chain and runtime security. Ensures every artifact is verifiable.

## Next Steps
- Expand policies for multi-agent interactions.
- Automate SBOM + Cosign signing in CI/CD.
