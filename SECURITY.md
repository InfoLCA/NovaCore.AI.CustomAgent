# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We currently provide security updates for the latest minor line:
- **v0.1.x** — active

## Reporting a Vulnerability (Responsible Disclosure)
**Preferred:** Use GitHub’s “Report a vulnerability” flow in this repo:
- Go to **Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability**.
- Include a minimal repro, affected versions/commit, impact, and any logs/traces.
- We will triage within **5 business days** and keep you updated.

**Fallback (if GitHub Advisories isn’t available):**
Email **security@infolca.com** with the same details. (If this address differs, update this file.)

## Coordination & Disclosure Timeline
- We confirm receipt within **5 business days**.
- We target a fix or mitigation within **90 days** of confirmation (sooner for critical issues).
- We coordinate a disclosure date once a patch or mitigation is available.

## Scope
- Code in this repository and officially released Docker images/artifacts.
- Excludes 3rd-party dependencies (report those upstream).

## Thank You
We credit reporters in the CHANGELOG (optional, on request) once a fix is released.
